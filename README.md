# Project-Accujournal
A search engine website for indexed authenticated research journals with querying facilities.

This was a project I did in my final semester of my B.Sc. Computer Science Degree along with Brother Chiruhas Bonam.
We were mentored by Dr. K. Vengata Krishnan Sir throughout the project.
I am really thankful to Brother Chiruhas and our mentor Dr. K. Vengata Krishnan Sir for guiding us throughout the project and 
all of the support they have provided to me while completing the project.

On a sidenote, if you would like to know more about the project, I have attached a PROJECT REPORT of Accujournal.
You are gladly welcome to give a look at it.

Thank you very much.
